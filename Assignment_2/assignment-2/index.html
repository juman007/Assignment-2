                        <p class="para-1"><strong>Peafowl</strong>is a common name for two bird species in the genera
                            Pavo
                            and Afropavo within the
                            tribe Pavonini of the family
                            Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl are referred to
                            as<strong>peacocks,</strong>and
                            female peafowl are referred
                            to as peahens, although peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as
                            "peacocks".</p>
                        <p class="para-1">
                            The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian
                            subcontinent, and the green peafowl
                            from Southeast Asia; The Congo peafowl is not a true peafowl, native only to the Congo
                            Basin. Male peafowl are known for
                            their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in
                            the Asiatic species, which
                            have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a
                            courtship ritual.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para-1">
                            The functions of the elaborate iridescent colouration and large "train" of peacocks have
                            been the subject of extensive
                            scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to attract females, and the
                            showy features of the males had
                            evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap principle
                            that these features acted as
                            honest signals of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the
                            difficulty of surviving with
                            such large and conspicuous structures.

                                The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly
                                metal-like blue and green. In both
                                species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but
                                males are significantly longer due
                                to the "tail", also known as a "train".[2] The peacock train consists not of tail quill
                                feathers, but highly elongated
                                upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock
                                fans his tail. All species have a
                                crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in
                                her plumage. The female also
                                displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.

                                Male green peafowl (Pavo muticus) have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black wings
                                with a sheen of blue. Unlike
                                Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, but has shorter upper tail
                                coverts, a more coppery neck, and
                                overall less iridescence. Both males and females have spurs.[3]

                                The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) male does not display his covert feathers, but
                                uses his actual tail feathers
                                during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and
                                green species, and the ocelli
                                are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or
                                brown.

                                Mature peahens have been recorded as suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage and
                                making male calls.[4] Research

                                As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily pigments, but
                                structural colouration. Optical
                                interference Bragg reflections, based on regular, periodic nanostructures of the
                                barbules (fiber-like components) of the
                                feathers, produce the peacock's colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the
                                layers of the barbules cause the
                                colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to the spacing of the barbules result
                                in different colours. Brown
                                feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure
                                and the other is created by a
                                Fabry–Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries.

                                Most commonly, during a courtship display, the visiting female peahen will stop directly
                                in front of the male peacock –
                                thus providing her the ability to assess the male at 90° to the surface of the feather.
                                Then, the male will turn and
                                display his feathers about 45° to the right of the sun's azimuth which allows the

                                of his train. If the female chooses to interact with the male, he will then turn to face

                                It has been suggested that a peacock's train, loud call, and fearless behaviour have
                                been formed by natural selection
                                (with or without sexual selection too), and served as an aposematic display to
                                intimidate predators and rivals.[9][10]
                                This hypothesis is designed to explain Takahashi's observations that in Japan, neither

                                Multiple hypotheses involving female choice have been posited. One hypothesis is that
                                females choose mates with good
                                genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger,
                                brighter peacock trains, tend to
                                have better genes[example needed] in the peahen's eyes.[12] These better genes directly
                                benefit her offspring, as well
                                as her fitness and reproductive success.

                                Runaway selection is another hypothesis. In runaway sexual selection, linked genes in
                                males and females code for
                                sexually dimorphic traits in males, and preference for those traits in females.[13] The
                                close spatial association of
                                alleles[which?] for loci[which?] involved in the train in males, and for preference for
                                more exuberant trains in
                                females, on the chromosome (linkage disequilibrium) causes a positive feedback loop that
                                exaggerates both the male
                                traits and the female preferences.

                                Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a
                                nonmating context that becomes
                                transferred to mating, such as Merle Jacobs' food-courtship hypothesis, which suggests
                                that peahens are attracted to
                                peacocks for the resemblance of their eye spots to blue berries.[14]

                                The peacock's train and iridescent plumage are perhaps the best-known example of traits
                                believed to have arisen through
                                sexual selection, though with some controversy.[15] Male peafowl erect their trains to
                                form a shimmering fan in their
                                display to females. Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signalled a
                                male's genetic quality by studying a
                                feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England. The number
                                of eyespots in the train
                                predicted a male's mating success. She was able to manipulate this success by cutting
                                the eyespots off some of the
                                males' tails:[16] females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to
                                untrimmed ones. Males with fewer
                                eyespots, thus with lower mating success, suffered from greater predation.[17] She
                                allowed females to mate with males
                                with differing numbers of eyespots, and reared the offspring in a communal incubator to
                                control for differences in
                                maternal care. Chicks fathered by more ornamented males weighed more than those fathered
                                by less ornamented males, an
                                attribute generally associated with better survival rate in birds. These chicks were
                                released into the park and
                                recaptured one year later. Those with heavily ornamented feathers were better able to
                                avoid predators and survive in
                                natural conditions.[18] Thus, Petrie's work shows correlations between tail
                                ornamentation, mating success, and increased
                                survival ability in both the ornamented males and their offspring. </p>

                            the causes for sexual traits.
                            Amotz Zahavi used the excessive tail plumes of male peafowls as evidence for his "handicap

                                indicator for females that these
                                highly ornamented males are good at surviving for other reasons, so are preferable
                                mates.[20] This theory may be
                                contrasted with Ronald Fisher's hypothesis that male sexual traits are the result of
                                initially arbitrary aesthetic
                                selection by females.

                                In contrast to Petrie's findings, a seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl
                                concluded that female peafowl
                                do
                                not select mates solely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence

                            A peacock's copulation success rate depends on the colours of his eyespots (ocelli) and the
                            angle at which they are
                            displayed. The angle at which the ocelli are displayed during courtship is more important in

                            than train size or number of ocelli.[22] Peahens pay careful attention to the different

                            during his display. The lower train is usually evaluated during close-up courtship, while
                            the upper train is more of a
                            long-distance attraction signal. Actions such as train rattling and wing shaking also kept

                            idea also suggests that the success of multiple signalling is not only due to the
                            repetitiveness of the signal, but also
                            of multiple receivers of the signal. In the peacock species, males congregate a communal
                            display during breeding season
                            and the peahens observe. Peacocks first defend their territory through intra-sexual
                            behaviour, defending their areas
                            from intruders. They fight for areas within the congregation to display a strong front for
                            the peahens. Central
                            positions are usually taken by older, dominant males, which influences mating success.
                            Certain morphological and
                            behavioural traits come in to play during inter and intra-sexual selection, which include
                            train length for territory
                            acquisition and visual and vocal displays involved in mate choice by peahens.[24]
